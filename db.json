            "second": "Hello, and thank you for taking a gander at my personal and professional profile. I am Paul Gene Adam, or for short...PGA. I began my career in software as a network administrator and hardware technician, moving slowly into the realm of software testing and development over time. Originally, I built developer desktop computers, along with Xen, and VMWare, servers farms for Resource Data. So for the start of my professional IT life I was learning AD DS, Exchange servers, MS task scripting and network security. In a fluke testing outing I did for the Army Reserve here in Boise, through RDI, I stood out as a having a knack for logical observation, and analysis; this led to me becoming a regular tester for the Boise branch, and even some mild HTML/CSS/JS dev tasks on regular client projects. My original software training and experience was primarily in C# .Net programming and MSSQL; a result of being relied upon for testing and front end dev work on previous client edeavors.  Early in my academic life I graduated with a BA in Philosophy, and an MA in Social Science Sociology; my passion for problem-solving and love of analysis was cultivated during both programs. Most recently, I graduated with triple honors from NuCamp, utilizing their online fullstack bootcamp to learn React, React Native, Python, and brush up on my SQL skills. I am currently a fullstack developer with my main focus in React-based development.",
            "third": "A former guitar teacher and guitar parts salesman, I try to make music a serious part of my life wherever I go. I also sing, after finishing KTVA (Ken Tamplin's vocal academy) and play a pretty remedial piano. I am a very bad golfer, about a 14 hdcp when I was serious; mostly known to squirrels as tree killer...lol. A great many years ago, I also was an open-classed billiard player; would like to get back to this a bit, but only once I can afford to buy a house and invest in a game room.",
